# AppleCD-600E-Bezel
A 3D-printable replacement for those disintegrating originals

Like most people, the bezel for my AppleCD 600E broke into many pieces. I recently took the time to glue together what was left and sit down with a ruler and FreeCAD to try to design a replacement. I had to extrapolate some parts as they were missing and then I iterated a few times into what is present here. The tabs through which the bottom screws go aren't strictly necessary, but I thought I'd include them anyway. It's working quite well on my unit without those tabs.

My use of FreeCAD is rather ham-fisted, but it's effective. I'm including the FreeCAD file for anyone who wants to make any tweaks.
